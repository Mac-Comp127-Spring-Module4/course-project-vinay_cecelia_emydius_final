Space Blast! 

Vinay, Emydius, and Cecelia

Brief Project Description:
Space Blast is an interactive game where you, the player can weave your way through space trying to rid the solar system of the scary aliens that exist! Be warned, you only have three lives and the aliens shoot back, so be careful as you dodge the aliens, because you if you are hit on your last life, you lose the game! 


What is different from your initial project idea (did you reduce some functionality? Added extra functionality? If so, what are they?)

We originally had multuple levels as well as the idea to get the aliens at the top of the screen to move back and forth but that changed given the parameters of the time we decided to changes that to instead have multiple lives (3) and instead of the aliens moving, they are shooting back at the player so the player has to dodge those lasers while trying to get rid of the aliens. 

Give a brief technical documentation or “guide” on how to run your code
Should another class run before another? etc.

Our code runs through a main method that will open the canvas board and allow the player
to play and interact with our game. This main method is in our GameSetUp.java file. Our GameSetUp.java file calls methods from other classes, like Laser.java, Sprite.java, Player.java, and Alien.java and then runs it in one concise class. 


What was the most challenging part of the project?

Translating from Breakout game and prior classwork to the game itself. Another piece that we found to be difficult was getting the aliens, which are on the top part of the screen to shoot back. The big difficulty in that was getting them to shoot in a synchronized fashion. There was also some difficulty in getting our collision methods to work correctly, though we were able to pull some of the method information from Breakout game and work with it.
